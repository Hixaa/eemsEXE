This system is to monitor entry and exit in confined space using UHF RFID. The main controller for this project is Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. But this can be replicated on any Raspberry Pi. The eemsV4 is specifically made to interface with CR33 RFID Readers

Getting Started
The project is spanning across one main folder xaees/ it has the source code for the project. There is a oneliner install.sh script which will automatically setup the system. For generating the documentation of the project I have used mkdocs and the documentation can be opened using

$ mkdocs serve
Installation
For installing just run the following command
